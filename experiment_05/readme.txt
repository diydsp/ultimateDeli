THis is a mean predictor


configurable:
numbre of lookbacks, 
distance of lookingback,
estimate of lookback region


strategy:
whiten data and normalize for:
price mean derived from OHLC
relative volume to a specific period


:Generate cube of desired results
:fill in various swaths
:store for comparison
:generate comparisons
:evaluate comparions


Compute a simple stripe:
start vector:
crosshairs:
timebacks
OHLC_avg
number_lookbacks
lookback_sequence

for all of number_lookbacks
  compute trajectory, e.g. all days


  compute each item in trajectory
  store
