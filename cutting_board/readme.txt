welcome to the cutting board!

this is *like* a tmp/ folder

it's where operations like slicing a larger file into smaller ones takes place.

typically, it contains a .csv of data pertaining to one stock extracted from a larger csv file!

feel free to erase it.  there is no code in it only data.

however, don't erase it if you're going to use that data soon.

typically, it takes a while to generate the data stored in here.

for example, it takes about 40 seconds to extract each ticker...

at 4000 tickers, that's 640000 seconds, or 4000 minutes, or 66 hours.  gah!

a faster way could be conjured up though when necessary!
