this program simply gets the names of each of the tickers.
to run it, just type:
python tickers_unique_gen.py

it will read WIKI_PRICES_blahlbah.csv
and create tickers_unique.txt


Also, note the file format.csv

it's simply the first line of the WIKI_PRICES*.csv file that indicates what each field is for.
